i686 PC-AT Bad Apple Operating system based off of the OSDev wiki.

## Requirements
---
* a functional CPU from at least 1997 (to play safe, 2000s or 2010s)
* PC-AT BIOS or CSM

## About
---
I made this project for fun, and as a literal joke. Why not, am i right? Perhaps, it's also a bit of a flex :p 

### Why isn't there source code.

Simple. I lost it. Idk where it is. If you want, uhh you can try to recreate it just see the OSDev wiki following sections:
* PIT
* Bare bones
* Cross-compiler
* Buiding GCC for i686

(not the exact names I'm not too sure)

## How to use?
---
Just write the ISO to a CD and boot it. Not that deep bro.
